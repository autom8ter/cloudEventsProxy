# stategate

A pluggable "Application State Gateway" that enforces the [Event Sourcing Pattern](https://microservices.io/patterns/data/event-sourcing.html) for securely persisting & broadcasting application state changes

What is Event Sourcing?

> Event sourcing persists the state of a business entity such an Order or a Customer as a sequence of state-changing events. Whenever the state of a business entity changes, a new event is appended to the list of events. Since saving an event is a single operation, it is inherently atomic. The application reconstructs an entity’s current state by replaying the events. 

> Applications persist events in an event store, which is a database of events. The store has an API for adding and retrieving an entity’s events. The event store also behaves like a message broker. It provides an API that enables services to subscribe to events. When a service saves an event in the event store, it is delivered to all interested subscribers.

## Features
- [x] [6 simple API Methods](https://github.com/autom8ter/stategate/blob/master/schema.proto#L15) for interacting with application state: 
    - `SetObject` sets the current state value of an object, adds it to the event log, then broadcast the event to all interested consumers
    - `GetObject` gets an object's current state values
    - `DelObject` hard deletes an object & all of it's events
    - `SearchObjects` queries objects of a specific type
    - `StreamEvents` creates an event stream/subscription to a given object type until fn returns false OR the context cancels.
    - `SearchEvents` queries events related to a specific object.
- [x] Capture all changes to an application's state as a sequence of events.
- [x] Stateless & horizontally scaleable
- [x] Native [gRPC](https://grpc.io/) support
    - [protobuf schema](schema.proto)
- [x] Embedded REST support `/` (transcoding)
    - [open api schema](schema.swagger.json)
- [x] Embedded [grpcweb](https://grpc.io/docs/platforms/web/basics/) support (transcoding)
- [x] Metrics Server(prometheus/pprof)
- [x] Authentication - JWT/OAuth with remote [JWKS](https://auth0.com/docs/tokens/json-web-tokens/json-web-key-sets) verification
- [x] Authorization - [Rego](https://www.openpolicyagent.org/docs/latest/policy-language/) based Authorization engine
- [x] Autogenerated Client gRPC SDK's
    - [x] Go

## Goals

- [x] Create a simple API interface for storing state and subscribing to state changes(events) using pluggable channel & storage providers
- [x] Capture all changes to an application's state as a sequence of events.
- [x] Safe to swap backend providers without changing client-side code
- [x] Type-safe client's generated in many languages
- [x] Safe to expose to the public internet due to fine-grained authentication/authorization model.
- [x] Different combinations of Channel & Storage Providers are interoperable.
- [x] Capture a persistant, immutable historical record of all state changes using a pluggable storage provider
- [x] Store identity(jwt.claims) & timestamp in event logs to capture who is changing what & when
- [x] Easy deployment model - fully configureable via environmental variables

## Concepts

- Storage Provider: A stategate storage provider is a pluggable, 3rd party database storage service. 
    - Storage providers provide persistance for all objects & events and should be scaled independently of stategate instances.


- Channel Provider: A stategate channel provider is a pluggable, 3rd party message-queue/channel service. 
    - Channel providers provide a way for stategate to broadcast events to itself while scaling horizontally. 
    - Channel providers should be scaled independently of stategate instances.

- Object: An object represents a single record(k/v pairs) with a given [type](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Type_system), belonging to a particular [domain](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Domain-driven_design)
    - Services/Users should use object related methods to persist & interact with the current state of an application/domain.
- Event: an event represents a state change to an object- events are persisted and then emitted to consumers anytime an object is created/updated. 
    - Events are immutable after creation and may be searched.
    - Event Consumers may search events to query the previous state(s) of an object
