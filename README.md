# stategate

A pluggable "Application State Gateway" that enforces the [Event Sourcing Pattern](https://microservices.io/patterns/data/event-sourcing.html) for securely persisting & broadcasting application state changes

What is Event Sourcing?

> Event sourcing persists the state of a business entity such an Order or a Customer as a sequence of state-changing events. Whenever the state of a business entity changes, a new event is appended to the list of events. Since saving an event is a single operation, it is inherently atomic. The application reconstructs an entity’s current state by replaying the events. 

> Applications persist events in an event store, which is a database of events. The store has an API for adding and retrieving an entity’s events. The event store also behaves like a message broker. It provides an API that enables services to subscribe to events. When a service saves an event in the event store, it is delivered to all interested subscribers.

## Features
- [x] 6 Simple API Methods for interacting with application entites & events: 
    - `/stategate.EntityService/Set` sets the current state value of an entity, adds it to the event log, then broadcast the event to all interested consumers(EventService.Stream)
    - `/stategate.EntityService/Edit` overwrites the k/v pairs present in the entity request without replacing the entire entity. It then adds the state change to the event log, then broadcast the event to all interested consumers(EventService.Stream)
    - `/stategate.EntityService/Get` gets an entity's current state
    - `/stategate.EntityService/Del` hard deletes an entity from current state store, adds it's state prior to deletion to the event log, then broadcast the event to all interested consumers(EventService.Stream) 
    - `/stategate.EntityService/Search` queries the current state of entities
    - `/stategate.EventService/Stream` creates an event stream/subscription to changes to entities. Glob matching is supported.
    - `/stategate.EventService/Search` queries historical events
- [x] Capture all changes to an application's state as a sequence of events.
- [x] Stateless & horizontally scaleable
- [x] Native [gRPC](https://grpc.io/) support
    - [protobuf schema](schema.proto)

- [x] Authentication - JWT/OAuth with remote [JWKS](https://auth0.com/docs/tokens/json-web-tokens/json-web-key-sets) verification
- [x] Authorization - [Rego](https://www.openpolicyagent.org/docs/latest/policy-language/) based Authorization engine

## Goals

- [x] Create a simple API interface for storing state(entities) and subscribing to state changes(events) using pluggable channel & storage providers
- [x] Capture all changes to an application's state/entities as a sequence of events.
- [x] Safe to swap backend providers without changing client-side code
- [x] Type-safe client's generated in many languages
- [x] Safe to expose to the public internet due to fine-grained authentication/authorization model.
- [x] Capture a persistant, immutable historical record of all state changes to entities using a pluggable storage provider
- [x] Store identity(jwt.claims) & timestamp in event logs to capture who is changing what & when
- [x] Easy deployment model - fully configureable via environmental variables

## Concepts

- Storage Provider: A stategate storage provider is a pluggable, 3rd party database storage service. 
    - Storage providers provide persistance for all current entities/events and should be scaled independently of stategate instances.

- Channel Provider: A stategate channel provider is a pluggable, 3rd party message-queue/channel service. 
    - Channel providers provide a way for stategate to broadcast events to itself while scaling horizontally. 
    - Channel providers should be scaled independently of stategate instances.

- Entity: An entity represents a single record(k/v pairs) with a unique key with a given [type](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Type_system), belonging to a particular [domain](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Domain-driven_design)

        
        // Entity represents a single record(k/v pairs) with a unique key with a given [type](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Type_system), belonging to a particular [domain](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Domain-driven_design)
        // EventService clients should use the EntityService to persist & interact with the current state of an entity.
        message Entity {
          // the entity's business domain(ex: accounting)
          // must not be empty or contain spaces
          string domain =1[(validator.field) = {regex : "^\\S+$"}];
          // the entity's type (ex: user)
          // must not be empty or contain spaces
          string type =2[(validator.field) = {regex : "^\\S+$"}];
          // the entity's key (unique within type). 
          // must not be empty or contain spaces
          string key =3[(validator.field) = {regex : "^\\S+$"}];
          // the entity's values (k/v pairs)
          google.protobuf.Struct values = 4[(validator.field) = {msg_exists : true}];
        }

- Event: 
    

        // Event is primitive that represents a single state change to an entity
        // Events are persisted to history & broadcasted to interested consumers(Stream) any time an entity is created/modified/deleted
        // Events are immutable after creation and may be searched.
        // EventService client's may search events to query previous state of an entity(s)
        message Event {
          // identifies the event(uuid v4).
          string id = 1[(validator.field) = {uuid_ver : 4}];
          // state of an Entity after it has been mutated
          Entity entity = 2[(validator.field) = {msg_exists : true}];
          // the invoked method that triggered the event(/stategate.EntityService/Set OR /stategate.EntityService/Del)
          string method =5[(validator.field) = {string_not_empty : true}];
          // the authentication claims of the event producer.
          google.protobuf.Struct claims =3[(validator.field) = {msg_exists : true}];
          // timestamp(ns) of when the event was received.
          int64 time =4[(validator.field) = {int_gt : 0}];
        }
