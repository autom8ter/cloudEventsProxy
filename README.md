# stategate

A pluggable API and "Application State Gateway" that enforces the [Event Sourcing Pattern](https://microservices.io/patterns/data/event-sourcing.html) for securely persisting & broadcasting application state changes

## Goals

- [x] Create a simple API interface for storing state and subscribing to state changes(events) using pluggable channel & storage providers
- [x] Capture all changes to an application's state as a sequence of events.
- [x] Safe to swap backend providers without changing client-side code
- [x] Type-safe client's generated in many languages
- [x] Safe to expose to the public internet due to fine-grained authentication/authorization model.
- [x] Different combinations of Channel & Storage Providers are interoperable.
- [x] Capture a persistant, immutable historical record of all state changes using a pluggable storage provider
- [x] Store identity(jwt.claims) & timestamp in event logs to capture who is changing what & when
- [x] Easy deployment model - fully configureable via environmental variables

## Concepts

- Storage Provider: A stategate storage provider is a pluggable, 3rd party database storage service. Storage providers
provide persistance for all objects & events and should be scaled independently of stategate instances.


- Channel Provider: A stategate channel provider is a pluggable, 3rd party message-queue/channel service. Channel providers
provide a way for stategate to broadcast events to itself while scaling horizontally. Channel providers should be scaled independently of stategate instances.
